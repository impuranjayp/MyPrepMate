## About
In today’s day and age online learning is booming. Every student can, from the comfort of their homes, access the internet and learning is on their fingertips. But each of these websites face a problem and that is all their tools aren’t down to one place. While one website provides the course, another might provide answers to the questions, and another provides the study materials and tutorials, while another might have related books to the subject material. This leads to a lot of hassles, as the students may need to register on multiple websites and even have to pay some of them to get access to the material. 
  MyPrep Mate aims at reducing this gap. At MyPrep Mate with all course-related material at one site all the students need to do is to register and at once everything is available to them. This solution is not only aimed at the students ease of access, but also to the ever-increasing costs involved in the access. At a reduced overall cost, students need not even spend largely for the coursework.
